What is it ?
------------
Catalog is a perl program that allows to create, maintain and display
Yahoo! like directories. The user interface is 100% HTML. It requires an
SQL database to run (typically MySQL, Msql, Postgres or GNUsql). 

The general idea behind the design of Catalog is that creating a catalog
is mainly a matter of organizing objects in a structured tree. For
Catalog the objects are records in a table of the SQL database. 
The structured tree is a set of tree nodes and relations between these
nodes. The maintainer of the catalog is in charge of building the tree
and placing objects in this tree.

Where is the documentation ?
----------------------------

If you have installed Catalog, it is on your local machine 
(see the Where is it installed section below). If you didn't
install Catalog, you can take a look at http://www.senga.org/.

How to install it ?
-------------------
See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.


Where is it installed ?
-----------------------

The main program is a file named Catalog that is installed in the
cgi-bin directory of the HTTP server running on your local machine.

The HTML documentation starts with a file named catalog_toc.html in the
HTML tree of the HTTP server running on your local machine (the path
you specified with the HTMLDIR variable when installing Catalog).
